# Structured-programing-project
This was the first project that was done in university, it is a basic implementation of candy crush.

It was not allowed to use classes or a .h file, so we had to only use structs and functions.

The animations and state machine and memory manegment were basic and sometimes bad for the memory, where I didn't know anything about them
by that time, and have improved them in future projects.

The file manegment is also really bad, I had learned how to manage them where I'll improve it in future projects.

The gui was made using SFML
